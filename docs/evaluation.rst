Evaluation

    :description lang=en:
        This benchmark tests how Python tools work on extraction of text from HTML code. Trafilatura
        performs significantly better than the other comparable libraries in internal and external
        evaluations.


Although text is ubiquitous on the Web, extracting information from web pages can prove to be difficult. Should the tooling be adapted to particular news outlets or blogs that are targeted (which often amounts to the development of web scraping tools) or should the extraction be as generic as possible to provide opportunistic ways of gathering information?

The extraction focuses on the main content, which is usually the part displayed centrally, without the left or right bars, the header or the footer, but including potential titles and (optionally) comments. This task is also known as web scraping, boilerplate removal, DOM-based content extraction, main content identification, or web page cleaning.


Alternatives
------------

Although a few corresponding Python packages are not actively maintained the following alternatives exist.

These packages keep the structure intact but do not focus on main text extraction:

- `html2text <https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text>`_ converts HTML pages to Markup language
- `html_text <https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/html-text>`_ converts HTML code to plain text
- `inscriptis <https://github.com/weblyzard/inscriptis>`_ converts HTML to text with a particular emphasis on nested tables

These packages focus on main text extraction:

- `boilerpy3 <https://github.com/jmriebold/BoilerPy3>`_ is a Python version of the boilerpipe algorithm for boilerplate removal and fulltext extraction
- *dragnet* is not maintained anymore, it is provided for reference only (in older evaluations)
- `goose3 <https://github.com/goose3/goose3>`_ can extract information for embedded content but doesn't preserve markup
- `jusText <https://github.com/miso-belica/jusText>`_ is designed to preserve mainly text containing full sentences along with some markup, it has been explicitly developed to create linguistic resources
- `newspaper3k <https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper>`_ is mostly geared towards newspaper texts, provides additional functions but no structured text or comment extraction
- `news-please <https://github.com/fhamborg/news-please>`_ is a news crawler that extracts structured information
- `readability-lxml <https://github.com/buriy/python-readability>`_ cleans the page and preserves some markup
- `readabilipy <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/ReadabiliPy>`_ contains a Python wrapper for Mozilla's Node.js package, as well as article extraction routines written in pure Python
- `trafilatura <https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura>`_ is the library documented here, several options are tested regarding main text extraction only, without metadata or comments

The tools are compared to the raw page source and to a meaningful baseline consisting of extracting the raw text contained in the JSON article element or in a combination of paragraph, code and quote elements.


Description
-----------

**Test set**: The experiments below are run on a collection of documents which are either typical for Internet articles (news outlets, blogs). Some are harder to process due to mixed content (lists, tables) or not fully valid HTML code. They are selected from `large collections of web pages in German <https://www.dwds.de/d/k-web>`_, for the sake of completeness documents in other languages are added (notably English, French, other European languages, Chinese and Arabic, about 20-30% of the total).

**Evaluation**: Decisive document segments are singled out which are not statistically representative but very significant in the perspective of working with the texts, most notably left/right columns, additional header, author or footer information such as imprints or addresses, as well as affiliated and social network links, in short boilerplate. Raw text segments are expected which is also a way to evaluate the quality of HTML extraction in itself.

**Time**: The execution time is provided as an indication. As the baseline extraction is simple and fast, it is used for the benchmark. Certain packages are noticeably slower than the rest: *goose3* and *newspaper*, while *news-please*'s execution time isn't comparable because of operations unrelated to text extraction. ReadabiliPy is very slow for unclear reasons.

**Errors**: The *boilerpy3*, *newspaper3k*, and *readabilipy* modules do not work without errors on every HTML file in the test set, probably because of malformed HTML, encoding or parsing bugs. These errors are ignored in order to complete the benchmark.

**Results**: The baseline beats a few systems, showing its interest. *justext* is highly configurable and tweaking its configuration (as it is done here) can lead to better performance than its generic settings. *goose3* is the most precise algorithm, albeit at a significant cost in terms of recall. The packages focusing on raw text extraction *html_text* and *inscriptis* are roughly comparable and achieve the best recall as they try to extract all the text. Rule-based approaches such as *trafilatura*'s obtain balanced results despite a lack of precision. Combined with an algorithmic approach they perform significantly better than the other tested solutions.

**Roadmap**: Further evaluations will be run, including additional tools and languages. Comment extraction still has to be evaluated, although most libraries don not offer this functionality.

The evaluation script is available on the project repository: `tests/README.rst <https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura/blob/master/tests/>`_. To reproduce the tests just clone the repository, install all necessary packages and run the evaluation script with the data provided in the *tests* directory.
