<blockquote>
<P>
A while back I went to a great <a href="http://www.tclug.org/">TCLUG<a/> meeting with Mick Bauer giving the main presentation.
I was impressed enough with his presentation to purchase a copy of his book: <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/bssrvrlnx/">Building Secure Servers
with Linux</a>.  I also enjoy his Paranoid Penguin security related columns in the <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/">Linux Journal</a>.
<p>
One of Mick's columns and a portion of his book deal with setting up stunnel to tunnel rsync over
an SSL encrypted connection.  Unfortunately, I had a heck of a hard time getting this to work because
Mick's documentation examples rely heavily on tcp-wrappers and Stunnel version 3.x syntax.  Stunnel 4.x
has been stable for a long time and I always like to have my software up to date, so I wrote this
documentation to record my solution to this problem in the hopes that someone may find it useful and so I can
remember exactly what I did when I need to set this up again.  If you find any errors or omissions, please
feel free to <a href="http://www.netbits.us/contact.php">contact</a> me.
<p>
All right then, it's go time.

<H2><a name="source1">Building the Sources I</H2>
<blockquote>
As much as I like certain un-named Linux distros, I abhore dealing with RPM's.  This led to a natural migration
to Slackware and Debian as my Linux distros of choice, in that order.  Unfortunately, many people do not feel
comfortable working with source, so I'll go into detail on how to build the source for the three packages that
we need: OpenSSL, Stunnel and Rsync.
<p>
<H3>OpenSSL</H3>
<p>
This is probably an optional step for many users as almost all distributions come with a version of OpenSSL which is
usually installed by default as it is required by many other packages.  To find out, try the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>rpm -qa | grep -i ssl</li>
<li>which openssl</li>
<li>openssl version</li>
</ul>
Follow the steps below to install the latest version from source if desired.
<p>
As of this writing, the latest version of OpenSSL is 0.9.7c.
<p>Download the latest OpenSSL source tarball (.tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar, etc) from <a href="http://www.openssl.org/source/">http://www.openssl.org</a>.  You can
save the file to wherever you wish.  I like to keep downloaded custom source packages in /usr/local/source/ - whatever, it's
up to you.  Unpack the tarball using tar [z,j]xvf name_of_tarball.  (The z or j is option, use tar zxvf for .tar.gz, tar jxvf for
.tar.bz2, tar xvf for .tar)  Remove the tarball file and cd into the directory it created.  In this example, here are the steps:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Download openssl source tarball - probably something like openssl-0.9.7c.tar.gz</li>
<li>cd to the directory containing the tarball</li>
<li>tar zxvf openssl-0.9.7c.tar.gz</li>
<li>rm openssl-0.9.7c.tar.gz</li>
<li>cd openssl-0.9.7c</li>
</ul>
<p>
At this point you will configure and build openssl.  Openssl doesn't use the standard autoconf program but it's very close.  The next thing to
type is:
<p>
<code>./config --prefix=/usr/local --openssldir=/usr/local/ssl zlib shared</code>
<p>
You may want to change the prefix or the openssldir depending on your preferences.  Your distro probably already requires
OpenSSL so you should choose a location that will not interfere with the installed version of OpenSSL, Anything in /usr/local is a logical
choice.
<p>
After this type: <code>make</code>
<p>
If you get errors on zlib, make sure you have zlib-devel (on RPM systems) or zlib1g-dev on Debian.
<p>
This will probably take a few minutes depending on your system, once it's finished, type <code>su</code> to log in as root, then type:
<code>make install</code> to install openssl into /usr/local/ or wherever you designated about with --prefix.  Type <code>make clean</code> to remove
objects created during the make process that are no longer needed.
<p>
Since your system probably contains another version of openssl, it's a good idea to make sure that you can find the version
you just installed.  /usr/local/bin should be in your PATH, so type:
<p>
<code>rehash<br>which openssl<br>openssl version</code>
<p>
Make sure the last command returns the version you just installed (0.9.7c)
<p>
Also, make sure that it can find the openssl shared library.  Type:
<p><code>ldd `which openssl`</code>
<p>You should see something similar to:
<p><pre>
# ldd `which openssl`
        libssl.so.0.9.7 => /usr/local/lib/libssl.so.0.9.7 (0x4001b000)
        libcrypto.so.0.9.7 => /usr/local/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.7 (0x4004a000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x40142000)
        libz.so.1 => /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x40145000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x40153000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x4000000
</pre><p>
Make sure that libssl.so.0.9.7 points to the lib directory in your --prefix.  If not, make sure /usr/local/lib is somewhere in
/etc/ld.so.conf and type: <code>ldconfig</code>.
<p>
Note that you should do this on both the rsync client and server as stunnel will link against the openssl libraries.
<p>
Ok, enough of this, time to actually do some work, it's time to make some certs.
</blockquote>
<H2><a name="cert">Generating Certs</H2>
<blockquote>
Much of this was taken from Mick Bower's book - openssl has a cryptic (IMO) syntax, I'll do my best to
explain.

<p>
To use stunnel we are going to sign our own SSL certificates.  If you want to pay Verisign $200 a year to get
3rd party signed certs, by all means go ahead, but for tunneling you do not need to pay anyone to sign certificates.
In the https world of secure web transmissions, it's important because the client (your web browser) needs the
certificate to verify the identity of the server, in our case though, it's the server (rsync, or more specifically stunnel)
that needs to verify client connections.
In addition, chances are you will generate both the client and the server certificates for the purposes of tunneling instead
of handing them out to strangers.  For these reasons, the server can quite safely and affordable be it's own CA (Certificate Authority).
<p>
To be a certificate authority though, you need to perform some simple steps with openssl.
<p>
First, cd to /usr/local/ssl (or wherever you chose for --sysconfdir).
<p>
In this directory, you will find an openssl.conf file, open it with your favorite editor.
<p>Change the follwoing values:
<p>
<code>dir = ./demoCA</code> (change ./demoCA to something more appropriate, like ./localCA or ./CA)
<br><code>default_bits = 1024</code> (Change to 2048 for more security - does not hinder tunnel performance)
<br><code>default_days = 365</code> (You might want to change this to a higher value so you don't have to resign your certs every year)
<br>You may also want to change the default values in the req_distinguished_name section so you don't have to type in
your country, city, state, etc. each time you use openssl.
<p>
Next, edit misc/CA.pl and change some of the same values, namely change $CATOP and $DAYS to match the values you used for dir and default_days in
openssl.conf.
<p>
Finally, type:  <code>/usr/local/ssl/misc/CA.pl -newca</code>
<p>
Press return at the first prompt and then enter a very secure passphrase.  I like to use sentences and not typical passwords
for openssl pass phrases as they allow puncuation and whitespace.  Something like "Don't worry, this is my 1st CA and it's
much more secure than a password like 52334XCq24sdf122, Dude!".  You'll want to remember this pass phrase though, so store it off site
somewhere extremely secure.  After this you'll be prompted from a number or certificate credentials.  For Organizational Unit Name you might want to type something like
"Certificate Authority", for Common Name you should use your domain name.  A challenge password is not needed.
<p>
Copy the openssl.conf file in the /usr/local/ssl/ directory to the new CA directory created, which is dependant on what you
set for $CATOP above.  You should edit the copy and set the CA dir parameter to an absolute path.
<P>
You now have your own Certificate Authority which you can use to sign certificates.  But first, lets tighten things up a little.
Type:
<p>
<code>chmod 400 /usr/local/ssl/CA/private/*.pem</code>
<br><code>chmod 500 /usr/local/ssl/CA/private</code>
<br><code>chmod 500 /usr/local/ssl/private</code>
<p>Make sure these files and directories are only readable by root!
<p>Now that you have your CA setup, lets create and sign some certs for use with stunnel and rsync.
<p>First decide which computer is your rsync server and which is your client.
For this exercise, frokhike is a co-located web server in Utah and langly is a computer in my basement
that has a lot of diskspace, access to a tape drive, and whose only purpose in life is to store backup data.
This scenario is not actually pretend for me, only the names of the computers were changed to hide the guilty.
<p>
In this situation, even though frokhike is a web server and a very important computer, it is the client in the eyes of our
rsync scenario.  langly is the computer which runs the rsync daemon waiting for clients to send it data.  (Remember, this is
not the only way to use rsync, it can certainly push data as well as pull.)
<p>Note that it doesn't matter on which computer the CA
is, it can sign and create certs for both the client and the server even if it is neither a client nor a server.
<p>
Let's start with the server, langly.  First cd to the CA directory.  Create the stunnel signing request and key with:
<p>
<code>/usr/local/bin/openssl req -nodes -new -keyout langly_stunnel_key.pem
-out langly_stunnel_req.pem -config ./openssl.cnf</code>
<p>
Here you will have to enter the usual openssl certificate credentials.  Use your domain name or the name of the computer (e.g. langly)
for the Common name and "stunnel server" for the Organizational Unit Name.  This will create two files, langly_stunnel_key.pem (the key)
and langly_stunnel_req.pem (the signing request).  An important note about this openssl command, the -nodes parameter specifies
that the new certificate should be unencrypted, which means that it will not ask for a pass phrase everytime you start the stunnel server.  This
is desirable behavior for a certificate for a daemon process that starts on boot.
<p>Now to sign the request with the new CA.
<p>
<code>/usr/local/bin/openssl ca -config ./openssl.cnf
-policy policy_anything -out langly_stunnel_pubcert.pem -infiles langly_stunnel_req.pem</code>
<p>
You will be required for the CA pass phrase to complete the signing.  Enter y at the "are you sure?" prompts.
<p>
Some versions of stunnel require a specially formatted certificate, so we're not quite done yet.  Edit langly_stunnel_key.pem and add a single
blank line at the end.  Edit langly_stunnel_pubcert.pem and delete everything up to, but not including the line: "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----".
Note that you can look at this information again by examining the files in the newcerts directory in the CA directory.
Also add a single blank line at the end of this file.  Finally, type:
<p>
<code>cat langly_stunnel_key.pem langly_stunnel_pubcert.pem > langly_stunnel_cert.pem</code>
You should chmod 400 the key file and the cert as it contains a copy of the key.
<p>
The client certificate can be created in exactly the same fashion, except change the name of the files to something else like
frohike_stunnel_req.pem, etc. and change the Common Name to the domain name or computer name of the client and the Organizational
Unit Name to "stunnel client" or something similar.  This is important as the certificates cannot have the same exact credentials.
<p>
That's it!  We'll copy/move the *_stunnel_cert.pem files to the client/server in the stunnel configuration section.
</blockquote>
<H2><a name="source2">Building the Sources II</H2>
<blockquote>
In order to have a stunnel'd rsync connection, it follows that you probably need to install rsync and stunnel.  The process
is pretty painless, but it should be done on both the cleint and the server.
<h3>Stunnel</h3>
Log out of the root account and download the latest version of the stunnel source code from <A href="http://www.stunnel.org/download/source.html">http://www.stunnel.org</a>.
<p>
As of this writing, the latest version of stunnel is 4.05.
<p>
Follow the same process to uncompress the tarball as in the <a href="#sources">OpenSSL</a> section.
<p>
Chances are that you do not have stunnel installed, but it might be useful to check just in case.  If you have it and you
know you are not using it, it'd be prudent to remove it.
<p>
The configure command to build stunnel that I recommend is:
<p>
<code>./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-tcp-wrappers --with-ssl=/usr/local --sysconfdir=/etc
</code><p>
The --with-ssl directory is the same as the --prefix used in the OpenSSL config command.  If you use your
distro's ssl, you probably can omit the --with-ssl flag completely, if you installed OpenSSL as described above,
make sure you use this flag or the configure script might link against an older version of OpenSSL instead of the one that
you spent so much of your hard time building.
<p>
--with-tcp-wrappers requires that you have libwrap.a.  Make sure you have tcpd (on RPM systems) or libwrap0-dev on Debian.
<p>
Since you most likely do not have stunnel installed, using /etc as sysconfdif is convenient as it create a /etc/stunnel directory
containing the all-important stunnel configuration file.
<p>
Assuming that the ./configure command works, next type: <code>make</code>
<p>
As part of the make process, stunnel wants to create a test certificate and will ask you the usual openssl questions (country, city, state, etc.).
Since we will not be using this test certificate, you can just press return at each prompt to accept the default values, even
though they will not make sense.
<p>
If this succeeds, log back into the root account and type: <code>make install</code> to install the stunnel program.  The stunnel binary is in
/usr/local/sbin not /usr/local/bin so make sure it is in your path or call with a full path.  The program installs the test
certificate as /etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem.  You can remove this file as you will not need it, especially now that you can sign
your own certificates.
<p>
Log out of the root account and type <code>make distclean</code> to free up some space from the stunnel build.
<p>
You may want to type: <code>stunnel -version</code> to verify that it has libwrap support - check for LIBWRAP in the first line of output.
<h3>rsync</h3>
Rsync is the actual program we are going to tunnel and the last piece of the puzzle.  Some systems may or may not install
rsync by default.  If it is and you feel comfortable, you should probably remove it as we'll now install the new version.
<p>
Download the latest version of the rsync source code from <A href="http://samba.org/ftp/rsync/">http://www.samba.org/rsync/</a>.
<p>
As of this writing, the latest version of stunnel is 2.6.0.
<p>
Follow the same process to uncompress the tarball as in the <a href="#sources">OpenSSL</a> section.
<p>
The configure command to build rsync that I recommend is:
<p>
<code>./configure --prefix=/usr/local --sysconfdir=/etc
</code>
<p>The process should be familiar by now:
<p>
<code>make
<br>su
<br>make install
<br>make distclean
</code>
Now that all the software is installed (on both client and server), we'll configure and test.
</blockquote>
<H2><a name="rsync">Configuring Rsync</H2>
<blockquote>
There are a variety of uses to the rsync program, just look at rsync --help or man rsync to see the huge number of options.
What I primarily use rsync for is for backing up important files to an off-site computer.  It's great for backups as rsync only copies the
differences between files, it doesn't copy the entire file, which can save dramatic bandwidth depending on your situation.
<p>
So let's go back to our pretend scenario.   Recall that frohike is the client and langly is the server, and that
the client frohike is pushing important, possibly sensitive backup data over TCP/IP to my basement rsync server langly.
<p>
We'll start with rsync.  There is fortunately no configuration that needs to be done on the client side.  All that needs
to happen on the client is a command line call to rsync.  The server on the other hand requires configuration.  Here is what I
use in /etc/rsyncd.conf
<p><pre>
syslog facility = local5

use chroot = yes
uid = root
gid = root
max connections = 10
timeout = 600
read only = yes

[frohike]
        path = /backup/frohike
        comment = Frohike Backups
        hosts allow = 127.0.0.1
        read only = no
        ignore nonreadable = yes
        refuse options = checksum
        dont compress = *
</pre><p>
You will need to look at the manpage for rsyncd.conf to determine what to place in your config file,
but you should be able to tweek this to meet your needs.  Couple important notes:
<p>
Do NOT change hosts allow to the actual IP address of your client.  Because the connection to rsync is tunnelled, it
actually appears to the rsync daemon to be coming from a local process, hence the 127.0.0.1.
<p>The directory in path needs to exist before you can transfer files.
<p>Since I am transfering backup files that may be owned by root, I had difficulty getting rsync to work without
setting the uid and gid to root.  You may not want to do this depending on your usage.
<p>
syslog facility allows me to direct all rsync log messages to /var/log/rsyncd.log by placing this line in /etc/syslog.conf
<p><code>local5.* /var/log/rsyncd.log</code>
<P>You do do the same, or remove this completely, logging will go to whatever log has the
deamon facility.
<p>
You can start the rsync daemon simply by executing /usr/local/bin/rsync --daemon - probably a good thing to start on boot -
use whatever method you are familiar with.  I recommend <a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">daemontools</a>.
The following run script works for daemontools (the only difference being the --no-detach):
<p><pre>
#!/bin/sh

/usr/local/bin/rsync --daemon --no-detach
</pre><p>
Note, there is no config file parameter (that I know of) to increase the debug level of logging, however, you can pass -v or -vv
to the rsync startup command to get verbose and very verbose logs.
</blockquote>
<H2><a name="stunnel">Configuring Stunnel</H2>
<blockquote>
<p>Stunnel is not quite as fun to setup, especially since the documentation on the stunnel page still shows a lot of examples
using the old stunnel 3 syntax.  But, once you get the config file syntax down it's not too difficult.
<p>
Before anything, copy or move the certificates created in the <a href="#cert">Generating Certs</a> section to the /etc/stunnel
directories on both the client and the server.  So copy frohike_stunnel_cert.pem to /etc/stunnel on frohike, likewise on langly.
<P>
Both client and server need to be configured.  The client needs to be told that when you attempt to use rsync over the standard
port (port 873), place the stream instead on a secure port using stunnel.  The server needs to be told to accept connections on the secure
port and forward them to the local rsync process.
<p>Following Mick Bauer's examples, we'll be using tcp-wrappers to control the access to these ports.
<p>First, choose a port that has no traffic on it.  Mr. Bauer uses port 273 for secure rsync, so we'll do that too.
<p>
First add the following line to /etc/services to give this port a service name:
<p>
<code>ssync           273/tcp                         # rsync over stunnel</code>
<p>
Next, edit /etc/hosts.allow and add the following line to let Local connections pass on the ssync port
<p>
<code>ssync : LOCAL</code>
<p>
Note, some systems like Redhat may have slightly different format, read your hosts_access manpage.
<p>
Now for the config file, this should be placed in /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf
<p><pre>
cert = /etc/stunnel/frohike_stunnel_cert.pem

client = yes
pid = /var/run/stunnel.pid

#debug = 7
#foreground = yes

[ssync]
accept = 873
connect = domain.of.langly.com:273
</pre><p>
Replace the cert with your actual certificate and "domain.of.langly.com" with something that resolves to an IP address
for the rsync server langly, or an IP address if no DNS records will do.
<p>
In addition to the many config file options supported, it might be very useful to investigate the chroot parameter, instructions can be found
<a href="http://www.stunnel.org/examples/chroot.html">here</a>.
<p>
The debug and foreground parameters can be uncommented to test stunnel from the command line.
<p>
The stunnel daemon should be running at all times on both the client and the server and started at system boot.
An init script with simply: /usr/local/sbin/daemon should do the trick.
<p>
Note that by doing this ALL connections on the standard rsync port (873) LOCALLY will be tunneled to langly.  This may not be desirable.
If not, you will either have to setup a second port for non-encrypted rsync and have the default port tunneled, or setup the
tunnel to accept connections on a different port (change the accept = 873 above to something else) and call rsync using: rsync --port=PORT
where PORT is the alternate port.  This way rsync by default is not tunnelled, only those connections on the port you choose.  Note
that the LOCALLY is in all caps, stunnel does not shut down port 873 and normal rsync is still possible by bypassing the tunnel (demonstration forthcoming).
<p>
On the server things are pretty similar, just a few more steps.
<p>
In /etc/services, this time add the following:
<p>
<code>ssyncd          273/tcp                         # secure rsync over stunnel</code>
<p>
Yes, the "d" is there on purpose.
<p>In /etc/hosts.allow, add the following line:
<p><code>ssyncd : xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</code>
<p>Where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP address of langly or a DNS record that resolves to the IP address of langly.  man 5 hosts_access
will give you more information.  Either way, you should restrict connections on the ssyncd port only to those connections you
expect, namely, only from the clients.
<p>
Finally, the config file:
<p>
<pre>
cert = /etc/stunnel/langly_stunnel_cert.pem

client = no
pid = /var/run/stunnel.pid

#debug = 7
#foreground = yes

[rsync]
accept = 273
connect = 873
</pre>
<p>
Remember to replace the cert with your certificate path.
<p>
That's it!  Hopefully....
</blockquote>
<H2><a name="firewall">Firewall</H2>
<blockquote>
Before testing, it'd be wise to consider your firewall.  Make sure traffic on port 273 is accepted and routed to the correct
computer (the rsync server).  You can safely block port 873 all-together since you now have tunnelled rsync, why even accept
it otherwise?
<p>
An IPTables rule that I used to accept 273:
<p><code>
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -p tcp -j ACCEPT --dport 273 -m state --state NEW
</code>
<p>An IPTables rule to NAT connections on 273 to my rsync server langly (whose ip is 192.168.0.2)
<p>
<code>
$IPTABLES -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $EXTIF -p tcp --dport 273 -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.2
</code>
<p>IPTables and firewalls are certainly out of scope, bottom line is to make sure connections on port 273 get to the right
place and connections on port 873 are dropped.
</blockquote>
<H2><a name="testing">Testing</H2>
<blockquote>
Ok, now to see if this pig flies.
<p>
To start out with, it'd be good to run the client stunnel, the server stunnel and the server rsync all in the foreground with
as much debugging info as possible.  Comment out the two lines for debug and foreground in /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf on client and
server and run rsync in the foreground using /usr/local/bin/rsync -v.
<p>
Once all three of these processes are running without complaint and waiting for connections, you can finally test the tunnel.
<p>
On the client, invoke rsync.  You might be tempted to do this:
<p>
<code>/usr/local/bin/rsync domain.of.langly.com::</code>
But this should timeout if you've setup your firewall to drop unencrypted rsync.  The reason is that you bypassed the tunnel.
Stunnel is running locally on the client computer, just waiting for a connection which it will then forward to the server.  The
right way to invoke rsync is with:
<p>
<code>/usr/local/bin/rsync localhost::</code>
<p>
Assuming you've set things up correctly, you should see something like:
<p>
<pre>
/usr/local/bin/rsync -vv localhost::
opening tcp connection to localhost port 873
frohike        Frohike Backups
</pre>
<p>
(-vv is very verbose)  If it doesn't respond after a second or two or errors out, you're on your own to figure out what's going on.  Check if all the
processes logged messages, starting with the client stunnel, then the server stunnel, then the rsync process.  If none of the
processes prints a message when you invoke rsync as above, the problem is in your client-side stunnel setup.  If the client stunnel prints
messages but the server stunnel does not, chances are the problem is in your firewall.  If the client and server stunnel print
messages but rsync does not, chances are that the server stunnel is miss-configured.  Lastly if they app print messages, chances
are that the rsync configuration is hosed.
<p>
If you get a positive response, why not try to backup a file from the client?  How about /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf?
<p>
<code>/usr/local/bin/rsync -vv -a -R --numeric-ids /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf localhost::frohike</code>
<p>
You should see something like:
<p><pre>

<p>And on the server you shoulld see the file in the directory you specified in the config file.  Note that rsync will
create sub-directories for you if they do not exist, as long as the root backup directory exists.
<p>Replace /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf with /etc to backup the entire directory.  The first time will take a while, but subsequent
backups will only change those files that have been modified.  This document will not cover the details of using rsync so you're
on your own to learn was -a -R --numeric-ids do.
<p>
So what is actually happening?  On the client side, instead of trying to directly connect to the server computer via port 873 (which
should be closed now) you are connecting to the local port 873.  Stunnel is watching this port.  When it sees a connection it
knows that it should forward all traffic from port 873 locally to port 273 on the server computer, but not as plain text, rather
encrypted using SSL.  The firewall sees a connection on port 273 and permits it, perhaps forwarding it to the right server as in
my example.  The rsync server computer has stunnel waiting for connections on port 273 (and incidentally local unencrypted connections on port 873
from within the firewall are still accepted by rsync).  When the server-side stunnel receives a connection, it forwards to the local port 873, but
first decrypting the stream so rsync daemon can understand it.  Responses work pretty much the same in reverse.
<p>
Hopefully at this point you have a working rsync tunnel.  Create some init scripts that start all processes on boot up and
you should be finished.  The fun part is over, now you have to design a backup policy and write
a nightly rsync cron job.
