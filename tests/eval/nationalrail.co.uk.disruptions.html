                <h2><span style="font-size: 20px;">Rail Replacement Services Travel Advice</span></h2>

                <p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Please find below helpful travel advice if you need to travel on a rail replacement service. Buses, coaches and taxis&#160;are different to trains, so there will be things you can expect on a train that are not possible or practical for us to&#160;provide on a replacement service.</strong></span></p>

                <p><img alt="" src="/border1c.jpg" /></p>

                <h2><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>General Information</strong></span></h2>

                <p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Rail replacement service provisions can be&#160;different for each train company, but there are some general rules that apply to them all:</span></p>

                <ul>
                  <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">You should have a <strong>valid train ticket</strong> <em>before</em> you get on the bus.</span></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Non-folding bicycles <strong>cannot</strong> be taken on the bus. There may be limited space available for folded bicycles, so entry will be at the drivers discretion.</span></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Assistance dogs will always be carried.</span></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Alcohol is <strong>not allowed</strong> on the rail replacement bus or coach.</span></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Customers with disabilities will be asked about the best journey options to enable them to travel.&#160; We may offer a range of choices including taxi, minibus, a diverted journey, bus or coach.&#160; We may be limited by suppliers available at the time of the journey.</span></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">All rail&#160;replacement services will display the destination, train company name and <strong>&quot;RAIL REPLACEMENT&quot;</strong> wording.</span></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Railway staff will be available to assist customers&#160;at stations which are ordinarily staffed. Where rail replacement services call at bus stops and meeting points&#160;close to, but away from, the station (e.g. if the road approaching a station&#160;cannot fit a double-decker bus) and at quieter, non-staffed stations, there will be no railway staff to assist.</span></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">A different timetable operates when rail replacement services are in use, and journeys may take longer than usual. However,&#160;if the replacement services&#160;are significantly delayed against that temporary change to the normal&#160;timetable, you can claim for delay compensation in the usual way, with the agreed operator thresholds (see</span> <a href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/209242.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 13px;">www.nationalrail.co.uk/compensation</span></a> <span style="font-size: 13px;">for details on operator delay thresholds and how to claim).</span></li>
                </ul>

                <p><img alt="" src="/border1c.jpg" /></p>

                <h2><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Station Infomation</strong></span></h2>

                <p><span style="font-size: 13px;">You can find the pick up and drop off location of a rail replacement service by checking wayfinder signs at stations, or by searching for your start or destination station on our Station Information pages</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-size: 13px;">We also have information to help you find out more about the different types of</span> <a href="/service_disruptions/RRV.aspx"><span style="font-size: 13px;">rail replacement vehicles</span></a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&#160;(bus coach, taxi etc.).</span></p>

                <h2><span style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Rail Replacement Services &amp; Coronavirus</span></span></h2>

                <p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Coach and Bus operators supplying rail replacement vehicles are also working hard to ensure that all enhanced cleaning standards are met, including:</span></p>

                <ul>
                  <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">a greater focus on cleaning high-touch areas&#160;on vehicles; (such as handrails),</span></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">increasing the use of antiviral cleaning products</span></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li><span><span style="font-size: 13px;">Where coaches have the facilities, ensuring toilets are well stocked with soap</span></span></li>
                </ul>

                <p><span><span style="font-size: 13px;">There is more information on how Coronavirus has affected National Rail services at <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/coronavirus" target="_blank">www.nationalrail.co.uk/coronavirus</a></span></span></p>

                <h2><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">Train Operating Companies</span></strong></h2>

                <p><span style="font-size: 13px;">We have asked the train operating companies&#160;the most frequently asked questions about their&#160;replacement vehicles, including the type of vehicle used, whether they can carry a bicycle, pushchair or pram, leashed animals and luggage, wheelchairs or&#160;mobility scooters etc.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Their comprehensive and informative answers can be found below.
